For a person with high inertia (both metaphorical and realistic), getting up, and leaving the comfort zone is a problem.
Little everyone knows that it isn't only to leave the comfort zone that's hard, but also returning to it.
Recently I put in my mind that I’ll get a portfolio. Everything was working well, the ideas were on a really good flow, pouring like an open faucet. But soon my bucket was full.
Any sane person would take a break, but this doesn't work for everyone. My mind would not stop.
I was forced to take a “day off” from my private project. I was my own boss, and my boss told me to stop before it was too late.
After this forced break (forced on me by me), the inertia began to act, again. It was hard to reinitiate. But this time, the inertia was on the calculations, so I managed to bring these cycles to a more like bell curve: Slow start, steadily ascending, some time on the top, steadily descending, and slowing going to a stop.

If anyone has a problem with a mind that doesn't stop, look for a way to put it in an “automated start/stop process”. It will help. A lot.
