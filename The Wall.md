When practicing an exercise, if you do it long enough in the same session, you’ll hit a breakpoint, when it looks that your body simply gives up, and doesn't have enough energy anymore.

This perception is often called “the wall”, a barrier that shows that your body exhausted all the carbohydrates of your bodystream. The biology behind it it’s more complex, but these symptoms serve a purpose.

When hitting the wall, you’ll feel unmotivated. If you surpass, then some time later, suddenly the energy will be on a higher level (again, the biology behind is more complex than this, and involves breaking more complex molecules to give the cells energy).

Casual players often don’t even go close to the wall. More professional athletes will design some routines to bring the practice close, or even beyond, the wall.

But with your brain, the process its a little different. Your brain doesn’t have an energy surge, like your muscle, and even works in a different mode. 

When hitting the “brain wall”, you’ll be drowsy, feeling unrested and hungry. You won't be able to surpass the limit like when doing exercises. And even worse: if you replenish your energy, your brain will continue to work. The stress that your muscles demonstrate by the symptoms don’t have a similar effect on mental exercises.  It’ll keep going and going.

Don’t overdo yourself. Your brain exists to keep you going, and they will go as long as you ask. If you are feeling unrested, don’t only drink an energy drink. If you’re feeling drowsy, don’t go blind to the next cup of coffee. It’s hard, I know, even more so in this fast-paced world. But, give your brain the rest they deserve.

Be kind to your brain.
